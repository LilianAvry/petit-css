You can read the documentation [here](http://petitcss.lil.re/)  
Lil CSS also uses [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)  
Buttons, code containers, form inputs, lists and tables are based on [Skeleton](https://getskeleton.com/)  
The navigation menu is based on a [pen made by Mutedblues](https://codepen.io/mutedblues/pen/MmPNPG)
